# Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. It provides a wide array of on-demand operations, including compute power, database storage, and content delivery, to help businesses scale and grow.

### Core Concepts

* **Regions:** AWS operates through multiple data centers located in different regions across the globe. Each region is designed to be completely isolated from other regions for fault tolerance and stability.
* **Availability Zones (AZs):** Within each region, there are multiple Availability Zones, which are groups of one or more data centers. AZs are designed as independent failure zones, providing redundancy, low latency, and high availability.
* **Global Infrastructure:** AWS uses a secure cloud network with Amazon VPC and a core infrastructure backbone to ensure reliable and efficient service delivery.
* **Scalability and Load Balancing:** AWS supports automatic scaling of applications using Auto Scaling and distributes traffic across multiple servers using Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) for better performance and uptime.
* **Management Console:** AWS provides a web-based interface and a smartphone application for easy access and management of AWS services.
* **Pay-as-you-go Pricing:** AWS follows a usage-based billing model, allowing users to pay only for the resources they use.

### Key Service Categories

* **Compute:** These services help developers build, deploy, and scale applications.
    * **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** Provides virtual machines for scalable computing capacity.
    * **Lambda:** A serverless compute service to run code without managing servers.
    * **Elastic Beanstalk:** For auto-scaling web applications.
    * **AWS App Runner:** Quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs at scale.
* **Storage:** These services offer scalable and durable storage options.
    * **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Object storage for various data types.
    * **Glacier:** Low-cost archive storage.
    * **EBS (Elastic Block Storage):** Block storage for use with EC2 instances.
    * **EFS (Elastic File System):** File storage for use with AWS compute instances and on-premises servers.
