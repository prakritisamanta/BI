# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google that runs on the same infrastructure Google uses internally for its end-user products like Google Search and YouTube. It provides a wide array of modular cloud services, enabling businesses to innovate, scale, and manage their workloads without the overhead of physical infrastructure.

GCP is known for its strong focus on data analytics, machine learning, and open-source compatibility, making it a popular choice for organizations dealing with large datasets and AI initiatives.

Here's a detailed overview of GCP and its core components, categorized by their primary function:

---

### **1. Global Infrastructure**

Before diving into services, understanding GCP's global infrastructure is key.

* **Regions:** Geographically distinct locations (e.g., `us-central1`, `europe-west2`). Choosing a region closer to your users reduces latency.
* **Zones:** Isolated locations within a region (e.g., `us-central1-a`, `us-central1-b`). Deploying across multiple zones within a region ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
* **Edge Network:** Google's vast global fiber optic network, connecting data centers and providing low-latency access to users worldwide, crucial for services like Cloud CDN.
* **Projects:** The fundamental organizational unit in GCP. All resources (VMs, databases, storage buckets, etc.) belong to a project, which serves as a container for billing, permissions, and resource management.
