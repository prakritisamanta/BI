# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is Oracle's modern, second-generation cloud computing platform. Unlike its predecessors, OCI was built from the ground up with a focus on enterprise-grade performance, security, and consistent pricing. It's designed to run all types of workloads, including Oracle's own enterprise applications (like E-Business Suite, JD Edwards, PeopleSoft, and Fusion Applications) and highly demanding databases (like Oracle Exadata), as well as open-source and third-party solutions.

OCI is known for its "bring your own license" (BYOL) model for Oracle software, strong support for hybrid cloud deployments, and unique offerings like the Oracle Autonomous Database.

### **1. Core Infrastructure & Management**

Understanding the foundational elements is key to working with OCI.

* **Regions, Availability Domains (ADs), and Fault Domains (FDs):**
    * **Regions:** Global, localized geographic areas (e.g., `UK South (London)`, `US East (Ashburn)`). Each region is independent and contains one or more Availability Domains.
    * **Availability Domains (ADs):** Isolated, fault-tolerant data centers within a region, connected by a low-latency, high-bandwidth network. ADs allow for high availability by distributing resources across them.
    * **Fault Domains (FDs):** Groupings of hardware and infrastructure within an Availability Domain. Deploying across FDs provides anti-affinity, protecting applications from single points of failure within an AD.
* **Tenancy:** Your dedicated and isolated cloud environment within OCI.
* **Compartments:** Logical containers within a tenancy for organizing and isolating your cloud resources. They are crucial for access control, resource management, and billing.
* **Virtual Cloud Network (VCN):** Your customizable, private network in OCI, akin to a traditional data center network. It includes subnets, route tables, and gateways.
* **Oracle Cloud Console:** The web-based graphical user interface for managing OCI resources.
* **OCI CLI & SDKs:** Command-line interface and software development kits for automating OCI resource management.
* **Resource Manager (Terraform Automation):** OCI's native service for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, enabling automated provisioning and management of OCI resources.
