# OIC Gen3 New Features

- Oracle Redwood theme : The Oracle integration user interface reflects the Oracle Redwood look and feel, All screenshots, icons, and termonology has been updated in the Oracle Integration library accordingly.
- Menu specification: The navigation pane has been simplified to include all tasks in three categories: Design, B2B, Observability (previously Monitoring), and Settings.
- Shape determines your upgrade window : When you create an instance in the OCI console, you must choose a shape, either Production or Developement. The shape determines when the instance receives monthly and quaterly updates. Instances with a development shape receive updates two weeks before the instances with a production shape. Once you selected the shape, you cant change the shape of an instance.
- Real time billing and usage data: Billing happens on the number of actual messgaes consumed , not the configured number of messages packs. On the metrics Explorer page, the new graphs show the number of messgaes that you purchased and that you have used.
- Oracle integration Home Page metrics : View the total number of messages, total errors and the number of failed integrations. You can also view existing integrations or create new ones from the home page and view recent activities with their status.
- Cut and Paste elements in the integrations canvas :  A long-awaited feature in GEN3, which allows the cut and paste of a for-each loop, Scope, and all of its children. Earlier, we were able to reposition all single activities, but in GEN3, it allows us to move complex activities like For-Each, While, Scope, and Switch. It cut down on the amount of time needed for rework.
- Expandable and Collapsible actions : You can expand and collapse logic actions in the integrations canvas ( for example, a scope, while, for-each, switch and others) to see chile actions and view errors.
- Control activity stream data retention during integration activation : During integration activation, you will be prompted to select the tracing level. The level you select determines how long your data is available in the activity stream. Production: 32 days, Audit: 8 days, Debug: ( Not recommended) : 24 hrs.
- Activity stream enhancements : To improve performance, message payloads are accessible differently in the activity stream based on their size. Binary payloads can be downloaded from the activity stream.
Instance Id change from Integer to String or alphanumeric.
- New mapper functions : 3 new functions introduced. 
	- Matches
	- replace
	- tokenize.
- Test mapper enhancements : the test mapper supports the testing of mappings you created with tracking variables and local variables in assign actions.
- Mapper function, operator and XSLT statement embedded help.
- While using connectivity agent, basic authentication is not supported in generation 3. To install and use connectivity agent, we need to use OAUTH 2.0 token based authentication in installerprofile.cfg file.

## What new features does Oracle Integration Cloud Gen3 offer?

Oracle Integration Cloud(OIC) is a comprehensive integration platform designed to simplify and accelerate enterprise integration processes.
It offers a unified solution that easily connects applications, data and cloud services, promoting collaboration, automation and productivity.

With Oracle Integration Cloud Generation 3, users can take advantage of new features to improve the performance, flexibility and efficiency of their organization’s integration processes.
Now, let’s take a look at the most striking features of this new generation.

## Oracle Integration Cloud Gen3: a fresh, new design
Oracle Integration Cloud Gen3(OIC Gen3) features a completely new visual theme. Indeed, its design is built around the Oracle Redwood theme, which is more user-friendly and intuitive, as you can see in the images below:

![a2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc6e1dbf-8a7b-41e0-801c-3f3b8ba6d63a)

The navigation panel has also been redesigned and groups tasks into 3 categories:

“Design”, “Observability” and “Settings”.

“Design” replaces the “Integrations” selection of Generation 2, as it links to a similar sub-menu for :

- Creating and manipulating an integration
- Create a connection
- Creating lookups
- Create or import Javascript libraries
- Managing packages
- Download connectivity agent

![a3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d58dab55-6962-4803-b9e3-f37a1433e04c)

However, a new selection appears: “Event”. This includes the ability to create events! An event is a JSON containing information.

These can then be published by an integration (event publication integration) or used to trigger an integration (event subscription integration) once the event has been published. A maximum of 20 integrations can subscribe to events per service instance.

The “Observability” selection corresponds to the “Monitoring” selection.


## Projects, a new concept in OIC Gen3

What is a project in OIC Gen3?
 
Oracle Integration Cloud Gen3 integrates the notion of “Projects”, accessible from the menu.
 
A project is a set of resources (integrations, connections, lookups and Javascript libraries) that can be developed, managed and monitored as an independent unit from a single space. Unlike a package, which encompasses integrations and the globally accessible resources used by them, a project provides the ability to create resources (connections, lookups and Javascript libraries) specific to it and only it.

Other aspects differentiate these 2 notions, and notably the accessibility of each of them, as you will discover in the rest of this article.

A project can contain a maximum of 70 integrations, 10 connections, 10 lookups and 10 Javascript libraries. It is important to note that it is not possible to create publication and event subscription integrations within a project.

All elements of a single project are visible only within the project itself, providing a filtered view focused on what the user needs. The “Design” and “Observability” options are integrated into the project space, eliminating the need for the user to go to these same two options in the main menu.

In addition to simplifying navigation, projects have other benefits too!


## Oracle Integration Cloud Gen3: how to regulate access to a project?

A project can either be accessible to all users, depending on their service role (administrator, developer, monitoring rights, etc.), or restricted to a defined list of users.

By managing access to projects by users or groups of users via the role-based access control (RBAC) system, it is possible to isolate a project and make it accessible only to a specific group of users. In this way, multiple users working on different projects can work on the sameOracle Integration Cloud instance. This role system gives groups of users access and the right to view, edit and monitor only the resources of a project assigned to them.

What’s more, a permissions mechanism exists within the project itself. Depending on requirements, one user may be granted the right to create and edit project resources, while another user may only have the right to monitor instances of integrations within the same project.

Service roles (ServiceDeveloper, ServiceMonitor, ServiceInvoker etc.) assigned to each instance user have priority over permissions delegated within a project. So, if a user only has the right to monitor the instance, he or she cannot be given the ability to edit project resources. In terms of limitations, a maximum of 5 users or user groups can be defined for each project role (viewing, editing and monitoring).

Example of compartmentalizing an OIC Gen3 instance into projects

Please note that the rights defined on a project are not migrated at the same time as the project to another environment (test or production). The user who imported the project to another environment is by default the owner of this project. It’s up to him to assign rights to project participants once again.

This permissions system enables parent integrations of a project to call child integrations:

- for the same project;
- another project, but with access defined as public
- globally accessible, i.e. not part of a project.

It is also possible to convert a package into a project.


## What’s new in integration?

Oracle Integration Cloud Gen3 has streamlined its types of integration. From now on, only App-Driven and programmed integrations – the most widely used and common modes – are available.

It should also be noted that the ID instance generated for each, will now be alphanumeric and no longer a number. This can have an impact on your processes, which rely on the digital nature of the ID instance to function!


## OCI Gen3: parallelize your tasks with a new action

Another new feature of Generation 3 ofOracle Integration Cloud (which will please a good number of developers) is the ability to run independent tasks in parallel!

This improves integration performance and execution time. For this purpose, a new action (‘Parallel’) has been created. A maximum of 5 branches can be created in parallel.

Focus on the “Parallel” action


## Oracle Integration Cloud Gen3: mapper evolutions

It also announces the arrival of 3 new String functions in the mapper:

- Matches, which determines whether 2 strings match, or whether a string matches a given regular expression.
- Replace, which replaces one element in a character string with another given as an argument.
- Tokenize, which returns a sequence of characters constructed by dividing an input string according to a given separator.

Automatic saving of changes has been added, eliminating the need for the developer to ‘Validate’ changes in progress so as not to lose them.


## The connectivity agent and its new authentication mode

Basic authentication used by the connectivity agent to invoke endpoints is no longer supported in generation 3 ofOracle Integration Cloud. It has been replaced by OAuth2 authentication.

Installation of the connectivity agent is simplified, as most of the parameters to be configured are set automatically.

It should be noted that certain functionalities present in the OIC Gen2 version will no longer be available. Oracle offers alternatives for some of these cases, which you can find in the “Not Supported in Oracle Integration 3“.

You can upgrade from generation 2 to generation 3! To find out more, you can now discover the prerequisites and actions required to upgrade to Generation 3 on the Oracle documentation.


## Conclusion on new features in Oracle Integration Cloud Gen3

The new features of Oracle Integration Cloud Generation 3 open up vast prospects for improvement and growth for your organization.
