# Microsoft Azure

Microsoft Azure, commonly known as Azure, is a comprehensive suite of cloud computing services offered by Microsoft. It provides a vast array of services for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers. Azure offers a mix of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings, making it highly versatile for various workloads and business needs.

Azure is particularly strong in hybrid cloud capabilities, enterprise integration, and leveraging Microsoft's existing ecosystem (Windows Server, SQL Server, .NET, Active Directory).

### **1. Core Infrastructure & Management**

Before diving into specific services, it's crucial to understand Azure's foundational elements.

* **Regions and Availability Zones:**
    * **Regions:** Geographically dispersed data center locations (e.g., `West US 2`, `North Europe`). Choosing a region close to your users minimizes latency.
    * **Availability Zones:** Physically separate data centers within an Azure region, each with independent power, cooling, and networking. Deploying across zones provides high availability and protects against data center failures.
* **Resource Groups:** Logical containers that hold related Azure resources for an application. They simplify management, deployment, and billing.
* **Subscriptions:** The billing unit in Azure. Resources are deployed into a subscription, and usage is charged against it.
* **Azure Resource Manager (ARM):** The management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure subscription. It provides a consistent management plane for all Azure services, allowing for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) through ARM templates.
* **Azure Portal:** A web-based console for managing all Azure resources.
