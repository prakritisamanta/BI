## Business Intelligence (BI)

Business Intelligence refers to computer based techniques used in identifying, extracting and analyzing business data that helps business people make more informed decisions by providing timely, data-driven answers to their business questions. It delivers relevant information to the right people at the right time.

BI software runs against data stored in data warehouses, operational databases, ERP systems and transforms that data into attrictive and easy-to-understand dashboards and reports. <br><br>

Gartner defines a BI platform as a software platform that delivers few capabilities listed below:

`Integration:`

* BI Infrastructure
* Metadata Management
* Development Tools
* Collaboration

`Information delivery`

* Reporting
* Dashboards
* Ad-hoc Query
* Microsoft Office Integration
* Search-based BI

`Analysis`

* OLAP
* Interactive Visualization
* Predictive modelling and Data Mining
* Scorecards

<br>
## MicroStrategy
MicroStrategy is an enterprise business intelligence (BI) application software. The MicroStrategy platform supports interactive dashboards, scorecards, highly formatted reports, ad hoc query, thresholds and alerts, and automated report distribution. Interfaces include web, desktop (for developers) and Microsoft Office integration. MicroStrategy Mobile also supports mobile BI.

MicroStrategy is a Business Intelligence software that provides orginizations with greater insights to:

* Enhance cost-efficiency and productivity

<br>
MicroStrategy was founded in 1989 by Michael Saylor (CEO), Sanju Bansal (COO) and Thomas spahr as a consulting firm focused on multidimensional modelling and simulation.

With all of the requirements of an enterprise class business intelligence system in mind, MicroStrategy has produced a tightly integrated platform solution written in c++ and Java with Visual Basic, J2EE and .NET interfaces. There are two front end layers - one built using JSP, the other using ASP.NET - which provides the flexibility to run on Microsoft Windows, Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, Red Hat Linux, SUSE Linux or BP-UX operating systems.

<br>
`Benefits`

* Rich functionality for end users
* Power for project designers, report developers and analysts
* Control for administrators
* Scalability
* Reliability
* Security
* Efficient and sophisticated analytics
* Rapid query performance

<br>
### Components

It has the following components:

* Source Systems
* Data Warehouse
* ETL process
* Metadata database
* MicroStrategy products

<br>
`Source Systems (OLTP) `

Source systems are typically databases, file sources, web sources or mainframes that store transaction processing data. Transaction processing involves simple recording of transactions.

A bank is one example of a business with many different types of source systems. The average bank offers their customers a variety of services and, therefore, needs these different types of source systems to support their services. For example, consider the Automated Teller Machine (ATM). At an ATM, you can withdraw or deposit money as well as check your account balance. However, if you need a money order, you have to go inside and speak with a bank teller. The bank has different operational systems, each designed to perform tasks that are specific to the service. If the bank wants to see an unified view of a particular customer, all the information for each source system hato to be collcted and stored in a centralized data warehouse.

<br>
`Data Warehouse (OLAP)`

A well-designed and robust data warehouse lies at the heart of the business intelligence system and enables its users to leverage the competitive advantage that BI provides. 

While source systems are designed and optimized for transaction processing, data warehouses are designed and optimized for analytical processing. Analytical processing involves manipulating transaction records to calculate sales trends, growth patterns, percent to total contributions, trend reporting, profit analysis, and so forth. 

<br>
`ETL Process`

The extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process contains information that facilitates the transfer of the data from the source systems to the data warehouse. 

<br>
`Metadata`

It is the repository that stores MicroStrategy object definitions and information about the data warehouse in a proprietary format. It maps MicroStrategy objects which are used to build reports and analyze data to the data warehouse structures and content. 

<br>
### MicroStrategy Products

The MicroStrategy applications allow you to interact with the BI system. They allow you to logically organize data hierarchically to create, calculate and analyze complex data relationships. They also provide the ability to look at data from many different perspectives. 

A variety of grid and graph formats are available for superior report presentation. You can even build documents, which enable you to combine multiple reports with text and graphics.
